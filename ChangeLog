Changes from 0.9.0 to 0.9.1

	* Make preload compile on linux (does not work yet) (Frederik Eaton)
	
	* Fix bug in module loader (Frederik Eaton)

	* The magic char (#) is escaped when reading a virtual directory
	
	* Avfscoda correctly returns error codes when reading a file or a
	directory

	* Fixed bug in virt_open(), to actually return the file descriptor
	instead of zero. This fixes bad behaivor of avfscoda under heavier
	load.

	* Commented out HAVE_FIFO_BUG define in child.c. If you have a
	very old kernel, you need to uncomment this.

	* Avfscoda uses hash table for lookups. This improves performance
	for large directories.
	
	* Namespace uses hash table for lookups. This improves performance
	for large directories.  TODO: current namespace implementation
	doesn't honor the NSF_NOCASE flag.

	* Removed buggy 'mkdir' from redir.c

	* Added execve (only for ix86) to redir.c

	* Fixed deadlock in bzip2 handling

	* Utar (and archive) now correctly handle open/read/close for
	auto-directories

	* Preload is now working on Solaris 2.5 (thanks to Richard Curnow)

	* Fix bug in archive, for multiple opens on same file

	* Archive now handles gracefully the case when file type is
	symlink, but linkname is not filled in by handler. TODO: Handle
	symlinks in zipfiles

	* Handle archives which have '.' or '..' in their internal paths.
