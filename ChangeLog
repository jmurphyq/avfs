	* Fixed bug in runprog, which leaked file descriptors in extfs.

	* Added /etc/init.d/avfscoda improvements by David Hanak

	* Top level makefile fix: 'install' target now depends on 'all'

2002-01-17  Miklos Szeredi <mszeredi@inf.bme.hu>

	* Started merging Frederik Eaton's stuff: spelling fixes, comments
	and logging to stderr.
	
Changes from 0.9.1 to 0.9.3

	* Fixed PT_DTRACE bug in redir.c
	
	* Removed nredir cruft

	* Configure now accepts kernel source directory argument

	* redir.c now includes modversions.h

	* Fix bug in virt_readdir

	* Fix redir compilation so it finds the apropriate kernel headers
	
	* Fix redir module license tag

	* Emacs tweak installed in /etc/emacs/site-start.d so that
	ange-ftp doesn't steal files beginning with '#'. This does not
	affect the operaton of ange-ftp

	* Better cross compilation support

	* Ported to Compaq IPAQ (still needs better cache handling)
	
	* Fix truncation code in cache state (/#avfsstat/cache/*)

	* Support free space handling on filesystems not supporting disk
	usage and disk free information (e.g. ramfs)
	
Changes from 0.9.0 to 0.9.1

	* Make preload compile on linux (does not work yet) (Frederik Eaton)
	
	* Fix bug in module loader (Frederik Eaton)

	* The magic char (#) is escaped when reading a virtual directory
	
	* Avfscoda correctly returns error codes when reading a file or a
	directory

	* Fixed bug in virt_open(), to actually return the file descriptor
	instead of zero. This fixes bad behaivor of avfscoda under heavier
	load.

	* Commented out HAVE_FIFO_BUG define in child.c. If you have a
	very old kernel, you need to uncomment this.

	* Avfscoda uses hash table for lookups. This improves performance
	for large directories.
	
	* Namespace uses hash table for lookups. This improves performance
	for large directories.  TODO: current namespace implementation
	doesn't honor the NSF_NOCASE flag.

	* Removed buggy 'mkdir' from redir.c

	* Added execve (only for ix86) to redir.c

	* Fixed deadlock in bzip2 handling

	* Utar (and archive) now correctly handle open/read/close for
	auto-directories

	* Preload is now working on Solaris 2.5 (thanks to Richard Curnow)

	* Fix bug in archive, for multiple opens on same file

	* Archive now handles gracefully the case when file type is
	symlink, but linkname is not filled in by handler. TODO: Handle
	symlinks in zipfiles

	* Handle archives which have '.' or '..' in their internal paths.
