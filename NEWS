Changes from 0.9.1 to 0.9.3
   - Bugfixes (see ChangeLog for details)

Changes from 0.9.0 to 0.9.1
  - Lots of bugfixes (see ChangeLog for details)
  - Optimized lookups in large directories

Changes from 0.5.2 to 0.9.0
  - Major rewrite touching almost all interfaces and code
  - Magic char changed from '@' to '#'. I hope this is the last such
    change ;)
  - New handlers:
      o ftp (read only for the moment)
      o http
      o rsh
      o dav (contributed by Justin Mason)
  - Other improvements:
      o Indexing of gzip and bzip2 files. This achieves fast random
        access to the uncompressed files without caching to whole file.
      o Better disk cache management, tunable parameters in
        /#avfsstat/cache
      o Multi-threaded operation for avfscoda and preload
      o Philosophy change for preload method: only a thin client is
        preloaded, work done in a server
      o Write support is working in avfscoda, redir doesn't fully
        support this yet
      o Support for avfscoda with reiserfs (2.4.4 and above)
   - Degradations:
      o ugz, utar, floppy, are now read only. Will be fixed.
      o Preload is only supported on Solaris, old Linux libc's are now
        not supported.
      o A few things are missing from the preload method (you can't
        'cd' into archive, mmap() doesn't work, etc.), Will eventually
        be fixed.

Changes from 0.5.1 to 0.5.2
  - Fixed redir.c compilation problems with newer LIBCs
  - Made redir.c work on 2.4.x kernels

Changes from 0.5 to 0.5.1
  - Fixed installation problems

Changes from 0.4 to 0.5
  - Avfscoda introduced, because the preload method will not work for
    GLIBC 2.1 and up. 
  - Fixed minor bug in zipfile handling (jar files)

Changes from 0.3 to 0.4
 - 'External fs' from Midnight Commander. This provides handlers for
   rpm, deb, zoo, lha, cpio etc...
 - Performance enhancements with 'ugz' handler (now uses zlib)
 - Write support for tar-archives
 - Write support for gzip-files
 - Tested on Solaris 2.7
 - Changed module versioning scheme
 - Fixed some bugs:
    o Work around tcsh closing all file descriptors
    o Fixed symlink resolvation bug
    o Fixed floppy bugs (mtoos does weird things with 0 sized files)

Changes from version 0.2 to 0.3

 - Magic char is now '@' instead of ':'
 - Small path-format change (move it closer to the mc-vfs format)
 - Symbolic link handling
 - Solaris 2.6 support
 - Performance enhancements (e.g. 'cp -r' for .tgz, zipfiles)
 - Avfsstat handler: information about avfs
 - 'ar' handling (.a and .deb files) 
 - Floppy handling (read/write)
 - RAR-file support finished
 - Non shared mmap-ing of virtual files (some versions of grep need this)
 - BIG internal changes + minor changes to the module interface
 - Configuring with autoconf
 - RPM spec files for Linux GLIBC and libc5
