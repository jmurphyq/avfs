What Is AVFS
------------

AVFS is a system, which enables all programs to look inside gzip, tar,
zip, ... files, without recompiling the programs or changing the
kernel.

At the moment it supports floppies, tar and gzip files read/write, and
zip, bzip2, ar and rar files read only. Quite a few other handlers are
implemented with the Midnight Commander's external FS.

AVFS is (C) under the GNU LGPL (see the file COPYING.LIB) with the
exception of the tar handler, which is under GNU GPL (see the file
COPYING).

AVFS comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, for details see the file COPYING.

Forms of AVFS
-------------

AVFS can now be installed in two different ways. These are:

 - Avfscoda (NEW)
	This method in theory works on any Linux system which has the
        'coda' filesystem compiled in the kernel or as a kernel module.

	In practice it works best with glibc-6.1 or higher, and it has
        only been tested on 2.2.X kernels.

	It should be used in the following distributions:
		RedHat 6.0 or higher
		SuSE 6.1 or higher
		Debian 2.2 (potato) or higher

 - Preload
	This works on Linux systems with libc-5.X or glibc-6.0, and on
	Solaris systems.
	
	It _DOES_NOT_ (and will never) work on glibc-6.1 or higher.

	It should be used in the following distributions/systems:
		Redhat 5.2 or lower
		SuSE 6.0 or lower
		Debian 2.1 or lower
		Solaris


Using AVFS is very similar in both cases. Differences will be indicated.

The installation method is different. For installation instructions
see the files 'INSTALL.preload' and 'INSTALL.avfscoda' respectively.

Using AVFS
----------

It is quite simple, you just do everything with the virtual files, as
you would do with real files. Here are some examples:

Listing a tar archive:

  ls -l avfs-0.5.2.tgz@/
  ls -l avfs-0.5.2.tgz@/avfs-0.5.2/

Obtaining information about avfs itself:

  cat /@avfsstat      - prints copyright information and version
  cat /@avfsstat-m    - lists available handlers
  cat /@avfsstat-v    - prints version information

'cd' into an archive:
  (For the 'preload' method the shell itself must be started with
   avfs)

  cd avfs-0.5.2.tgz@/
  less avfs-0.5.2/README

Some more examples: (these are all shell commands, but of course you
could use any program: file manager, browser, editor, etc.)

Unpacking an archive:

  cp -a tarfile.tgz@/dir .
  cp -a zipfile.zip@/* .

  (For the 'preload' method, using '*' means that the shell must be
   started with AVFS)

Creating an archive:

  mkdir tarfile.tgz@+  
  cp -a dir tarfile.tgz@+/


  Note: The efficiency of this method is not yet the same as the
  'normal' archive creation method, but it should not be more than 2
  times slower.

NOTES:

1) ('preload' only) Since tar and gz files now have write support, tgz
   archives are not safe from stupidity anymore. The insides of these
   files are just as easy to modify as if they were not arhived at all. I
   think this is cool, but if you don't, do "chmod a-w archive.tgz"
   before entering.

2) ('preload' only) Input and output redirection to/from virtual files
   does not work. This is not a problem with the 'avfscoda' method.

   E.g. you can't do
           patch -p0 < patchfile.gz@
           tar tvfz /@a/tarfile.tgz

   only
           cat patchfile.gz@ | patch -p0
           tar tvf /@a/tarfile.tgz@ugz


If something doesn't work, then check the section 'Common Problems'.


Format of an AVFS Path
----------------------

As you've seen, the '@' magic character makes a virtual file or
directory from an ordinary file. Actually this is just a shorthand for
the full specification of an AVFS path:

  'tarfile.tgz@' is the same as 'tarfile.tgz@ugz@utar'

Note, the short version will only work if the file-extension is
recognized (most are), but you can always tell exactly what should be
done with the file by using the second method.

There are handlers which do not have a "base" file. The floppy handler
and the 'avfsstat' handler are like this, and ftp, http, etc. will
also behave this way. For example the

  /@floppy-a   or   /@a

mean the root directory of the A drive.

For a full explanation of the format see the file FORMAT.

The following "handelers" are available now:

  name of handler    type of operation      notes
  ---------------    -----------------      -----
  @ugz               gunzip                 internal, read/write
  @uz                uncompress             uses gzip
  @gz                gzip                   uses gzip
  @ubz2              bunzip2                uses bzip2
  @bz2               bzip2                  uses bzip2
  @utar              untar                  internal, read/write
  @uzip              unzip                  internal
  @urar              unrar                  internal + uses rar
  @uar               un-ar                  internal
  @avfsstat          meta information       internal
  @floppy            floppy                 uses mtools (mdir, mcopy, ...)
  @a                 first floppy drive     shorthand for @floppy-a

The following handlers are available through Midnight Commanders
'extfs'. These were not written by me, and could contain security
holes. Nonetheless some of them are quite useful.  For documentation
on these, see the files in /usr/lib/avfs/extfs.

  name of handler    type of operation
  ---------------    -----------------
  @uzoo              zoo archives
  @ulha              lha archives
  @ucpio             cpio archives
  @rpm               rpm packages
  @deb               debian packages
  @lslR              directory tree listings
  @ftplist           ?
  @hp48              ?
  @patchfs           browse patch files
  @mailfs            ? 
  @rpms              List of installed rpms
  @trpm              Useful inside @rpms


Writing new modules
-------------------

You want to write a handler module for XY? Great! Please contact me,
and I can give you some advice regarding this.

Credits
-------

David Hanak (dhanak@inf.bme.hu) has contibuted the "rar" and the
"archive" modules, and lots of ideas to AVFS.

The VFS in Midnight Commander, written by Jakub Jelinek and Miguel de
Icaza <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>, has greatly helped me write this
library, and will probably continue to do so in the future.

Pavel Machek, who is the current maintainer of Midnight VFS, and who
has contributed lots of ideas and the alien module (which
unfortunately I did not have time to get into shape) to AVFS. (If you
liked ':gz' better than '@ugz', then you can kill Pavel for that ;)
The 'avfscoda' solution grew out of Pavels 'podfuk'. Most of it has
been changed, but the original idea is from Pavel.

Koblinger Egmont <egmont@fazekas.hu> has written the "recursive
profile" scripts, set up the mailing list, and also sent me many good
ideas.

The zip and gzip file handler is based on the zlib compression and
decompression library, written by Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler.

The tar file handler is based on the GNU tar source, originally
written by John Gilmore.

People, who sent me ideas or bug-reports:
  Jan Niehusmann <jan@gondor.com>
  Demon of the Known Universe <psycho@dodds.net>
  Duncan Pierce <cmrdrp@soc.staffs.ac.uk>
  Scott F. Johnston <scott@fleetingimage.com>
  Larry Riedel <larry@riedel.org>

The Future
----------

I hope AVFS will grow up to be a standard virtual file library, for which
people can write handler modules (or plugins, if you like) for whatever
they want. Some things are still missing (most notably the network based
file systems: ftp, http, ...), but the module interface is beggining to
clear down. 

If you thing AVFS is a good idea, and you have any comments or suggestions,
please send me an email about them.

Have fun,

Miklos Szeredi <mszeredi@inf.bme.hu>
