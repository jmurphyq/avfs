UnCached FTP module
===================

Motivation
----------

FTP support is available for a long time in AVFS using the ftp module. FTP
servers can be accessed by entering /#ftp:some_server/directory/file and so on.
There are, however, some limitations. This module only supports read-only
access. All downloaded files are cached in the local file system which makes
additional accesses to the same file fast and also allows seeking in these
files. The downside is that even very large files will be cached which is
perhaps not always wanted (imagine downloading an iso image of a linux
distribution).

Introduction
------------

The ucftp module adds write support and additionally downloaded files are not
cached. It can be used just as the original module, whenever you did go to
/#ftp:some_server/directory/file you would now go to
/#ucftp:some_server/directory/file.

If you don't use anonymous access, you need to write the password to
/#ucftp_ctl:user@host.domain.org/password just like ftp_ctl for the original
module.

The features of this module are:
1.Write support
  Create files/directories
  Delete files
2.No file cache
  It can be a pro or con depending on your usage. Accessing the same file
  several times issues re-download every time so for a slow connection this
  could be problem. On the other hand, you perhaps don't want to cache
  very large files but just cp'ing them to the final location.

There are some limitation of this module too:
1.Seeking in files is currently not supported, just plain reading (or writing)
  from the beginning to the end.
  This can be a problem for applications relying on seek support.

Bugs and Problems
-----------------
The module is basically based on the existing ftp module so it should share
known and unknown problems. It's a new module and it's not much tested so
please report problems to the AVFS mailing list.

No guarantees are made for a secure implementation but if you use ftp instead
of sftp you should know about the security implications anyway.
